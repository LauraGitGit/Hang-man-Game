# Hangman (Console Version)

A simple Hangman game I built in Python using only the console.

## How to Run

 Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

1. **Download the project files**
   - Click the green `Code` button at the top right of this page
   - Select `Download ZIP`
   - Extract the folder to your Desktop (or anywhere you like)

2. **Open your terminal**
   - On **Mac**: Open the Terminal app
   - On **Windows**: Open Command Prompt or Windows Terminal

3. **Navigate to the folder**

   For example, if you extracted it to your Desktop:

   **Mac:**
   bash
   cd ~/Desktop/HangmanGame
   python3 HangmanGame.py
   
Enjoy!
